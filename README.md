# Software Engineering Project-PoliSAM
This repository contains all the required documentation for the software engineering Web-App project
that we have developed: The Polimi Study-Area Manager (PoliSAM).
The documentation consists of 4 separate documents: 
- A Feasibility Study Document (FSD)
- A Requirements Analysis and Specification Document (RASD)
- A Software Design Document (SDD)
- A Software Testing Document (STD)

## Post-Examination Documents:
These documents only contain the changes and additions that we have made after the oral exam based on the comments and suggestions given.

We did not combine them with the previous documents in order to make it easy to identify the newly added parts:  
- RASD-Updated
- SDD-Updated
- STD-Updated

Also, we have included the final presentation as requested.

The live version of our updated PoliSAM App can be accessed through this link: https://polisamupdated.bubbleapps.io/
